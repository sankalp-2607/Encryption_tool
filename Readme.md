# C++ File Encryption & Decryption Tool (Caesar Cipher)

A beginner-friendly project that implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm in C++.  
This tool allows you to **encrypt and decrypt text files** by shifting characters.

## About the Project
- Uses the **Caesar Cipher** technique (shifts alphabets by 3 places by default).  
- Can both **encrypt** and **decrypt** files.  
- Organised into multiple files (`main.cpp`, `encryption.cpp`, `encryption.h`) to follow modular coding practices.  
- Demonstrates **file handling** and **string manipulation** in C++.

## How It Works
1. The program asks for the **file name**.  
2. Then asks if you want to **Encrypt (e)** or **Decrypt (d)**.  
3. Reads the file content.  
4. Applies Caesar Cipher logic:
